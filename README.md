# Early-Detection-of-Alzheimer-s-Disease-Using-Deep-Learning
Undergraduate Thesis
Here, a CNN model is deployed to detect Alzheimerâ€™s Disease in earlier stages. To achieve
this, an sMRI dataset with five classes is used. CNN provided the highest accuracy (79%)
compared to other algorithms (ANN, RF, SVM, and KNN). The results of the three class
and binary classifications were similar to existing research. In the second part, each of the 5
algorithms is compared using their precision and recall score for each specific class for three
different types of classification (5-class, 3-class, binary). This is done to determine which
model is better at detecting a particular class for a certain type of classification when we
care about the true positive and false positive rates.
